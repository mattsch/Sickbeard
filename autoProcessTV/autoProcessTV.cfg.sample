#### PATH TRANSLATION ####

# IF YOUR SABNZBD AND SICK BEARD ARE ON THE SAME PC LEAVE BOTH OF THE VARIABLES BELOW BLANK!

# the following attributes are to allow you to translate the folder names in case your SAB is on a different computer than your SickBeard
# NOTE: If they are on the same PC or the paths are the same on both PCs then leave both of these blank

## Example:

# sourceDir=/dir/on/SAB/host/ # the part of the folder that's different on the SAB computer than the SickBeard computer
# destDir=Y:/equivalent/dir/on/SickBeard/host/ # the equivalent path on the SickBeard computer
